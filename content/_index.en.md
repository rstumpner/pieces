### What is this all about?
Together, there are many challenges to overcome, and we all contribute a piece.
During the opening hours of the Pieces tent, you can tackle various challenges in three ascending levels.
You can choose according to your preferences and decide when and how many Pieces you conquer.
'Pieces' will last a whole week (from Tuesday to Tuesday).
