### What is 'Pieces'?
Together there are many challenges to overcome
and we all have a part to play. 
You can choose how many challenges you want to conquer and when.
You have a whole week to do this (Tuesday
to Tuesday).

For some tasks you will need the help of other CaEx participants, 
Others you can only do in a certain place or at a certain time. 
Record each task for the pieces team
(picture or video), then you will receive a stamp in your passport during opening hours.
Whoever has collected 12 stamps receives a mosaic piece (pieces) 
and move on to the next level with new and trickier tasks.
The difficulty and size of the task increases with each level. 
There are 3 levels in total.

### Where can I find the next challenge?
On this website under challenges or at the Pieces cabin on the CaEx main square.
