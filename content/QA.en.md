### What is 'Pieces'?

Together, there are many challenges to overcome, and we all contribute a piece.
During the opening hours of the Pieces tent, you can tackle various challenges in three ascending levels.
You can choose according to your preferences and decide when and how many Pieces you conquer.
'Pieces' will last a whole week (from Tuesday to Tuesday).

For some tasks, you will need the help of a second group, while others can only be done at a specific location or time. For each completed task, you will receive a 'Piece', a mosaic piece, and your personal souvenir. Once you have acquired 12 Pieces, you will advance to the next level with new and slightly more challenging tasks. Each level increases the difficulty and size of the Pieces. There are a total of 3 levels.

You engage with the Pieces because the tasks suit your interests. However, at the end of the event, we will highlight the groups that have completed the most challenges.
